### Project Overview

This project involves the creation of a Data Warehouse using [Talend Open Studio](https://www.talend.com/products/talend-open-studio/)  and the visualization of data through graphs using [Power Bi](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/power-bi/). 

### Data description 

- Context

Formula 1 (F1 or Formula One) is the highest class of single-seater auto racing sanctioned by the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and owned by the Formula One Group. The FIA Formula One World Championship has been one of the premier forms of racing around the world since its inaugural season in 1950. 

- Content

The dataset consists of all information on the Formula 1 races, drivers, constructors, qualifying, circuits, lap times, pit stops, championships from 1950 till the latest 2023 season.

Here is the [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020) to dataset.

### Tools 

1. Excel : Data Cleaning 
2. Talend : Decision-Making Data Processing
3. Power-bi Creating Reorts
4. sqlServer :  Data base --> (star schema)

### Datawarehouse design:

The datawarehouse will contain 5 dimensions: dimDate, dimDriver, dimConstructor, dimCircuit, dimRace, and a fact table: factResults.
We will focus on the following KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) : Points, Laps, FastestLapSpeed, FastestLapTime, Rank.

The star schema is illustrated in the following figure.

### Feeding the dimensions tables:

- dimDriver

Having the same raceId, idDate, and circuitId is not problematic because all drivers participate in the same race happening on the same date, at the same circuit, but they will have different results (KPIs).

### Dashboard analysis ideas
Here are some visualization graphs created using Tableau.

1. The Formula 1 car manufacturers based on the cumulative sum of points earned by their cars. This provides an overview of the performance of each manufacturer in terms of points.

2. The second graph can displays the cumulative points of each driver over time, allowing for an understanding of the drivers' performance trends. By analyzing this graph, a manufacturer can select drivers whose points consistently improve over the years.

3. The next graph illustrates the rankings of drivers from different manufacturer teams over time. This helps identify the performance of drivers within their respective teams

4. Lastly, the graph shows the number of laps completed by drivers, categorized by circuit, along with their fastest lap speeds over time. This information allows manufacturers to identify the circuits that best suit each driver based on their number of laps and speed.

Here is pictures of the Dynamic dashboard created using Power bi desktop :

### Summary
In this project, Talend Open Studio was utilized to establish a data warehouse for the Formula 1 World Championship. Subsequently, the Power BI tool was employed for analysis and visualization to uncover insights on the performance of car manufacturers, drivers, and their suitability with particular circuits. üèéÔ∏èüìä
